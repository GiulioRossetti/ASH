    "\n",
    "**Segregation** is a fundamental concept in social network analysis that measures how individuals with similar attributes tend to group together. While traditional segregation measures focus on pairwise relationships (edges), hypergraphs allow us to study segregation in **higher-order interactions** where multiple individuals interact simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces **Random Walk Hypergraph Segregation (RWHS)**, a measure that uses random walks on hypergraphs to quantify segregation patterns. RWHS captures how likely it is for nodes with similar attributes to be encountered during random explorations of the hypergraph structure.\n",

    "## What is Segregation in Hypergraphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hypergraph, segregation captures whether nodes with similar attribute values (e.g., same gender, ethnicity, affiliation) tend to participate in the same hyperedges and their local neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Segregation in Hypergraphs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Email groups**: Do people from the same department tend to be in the same group emails?\n",
    "- **Scientific collaborations**: Do authors from the same institution collaborate more frequently?\n",
    "- **Social gatherings**: Do people with similar interests attend the same events?\n",
    "- **Online communities**: Do users with similar demographics participate in the same discussions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**High Segregation** means that nodes with similar attributes cluster together in the hypergraph structure. **Low Segregation** (high mixing) means that nodes with different attributes frequently interact.\n",

    "\n",
    "RWHS measures segregation by performing random walks on the hypergraph and computing how often nodes with the same attribute values are encountered. The intuition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a hypergraph is **highly segregated**, random walks starting from a node will frequently encounter nodes with the same attributes.\n",
    "- If a hypergraph is **well-mixed**, random walks will encounter nodes with diverse attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "RWHS returns a score for each node and each attribute, ranging from 0 to 1:\n",
    "- **RWHS ≈ 1**: High segregation (the node mostly encounters similar nodes)\n",
    "- **RWHS ≈ 0**: Low segregation (the node encounters diverse nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Variants:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Meet-wise RWHS**: Considers all nodes encountered in the walk\n",
    "2. **Jump-wise RWHS**: Considers only consecutive pairs of nodes in the walk\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Walk Hypergraph Segregation (RWHS) provides a powerful framework for measuring segregation in higher-order interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Two Methods:**\n",
    "   - **Meet-wise**: Global mixing (considers all encounters)\n",
    "   - **Jump-wise**: Local mixing (considers consecutive transitions)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameters:**\n",
    "   - **num_walks**: More walks → more stable estimates\n",
    "   - **walk_length**: Longer walks → broader neighborhoods\n",
    "   - **p, q**: Control exploration vs. exploitation (from Node2Vec)\n",
    "   - **s**: Minimum overlap for hyperedge connections\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Use `temporal_rwhs()` for time-respecting random walks\n",
    "   - Track segregation evolution over time\n",
    "   - Compare segregation across different temporal windows\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications:**\n",
    "   - Measure mixing across multiple attributes\n",
    "   - Compare segregation levels between groups\n",
    "   - Identify temporal trends in segregation\n",
    "   - Evaluate interventions designed to promote diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use RWHS:**\n",
    "- ✅ Analyzing group interactions in collaborative networks\n",
    "- ✅ Measuring diversity in team formations\n",
    "- ✅ Studying temporal evolution of mixing patterns\n",
    "- ✅ Comparing segregation across different attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Explore the [walks tutorial](02-walks.ipynb) for understanding random walks\n",
    "- Check the [attribute analysis tutorial](01-attribute_analysis.ipynb) for other attribute-based measures\n",
    "- See the [multiego tutorial](05-multiego.ipynb) for group-centric analysis\n",
