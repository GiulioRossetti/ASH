    "3. **Rich attributes**: Both nodes and hyperedges can have attributes, which can change over time\n",

    "- Hyperedges represent papers written by two or more authors\n",

    "This setting is adequately modeled with a hypergraph, as collaborations typically go beyond pairs of authors. With ASH, you can study how these collaborations evolve over time (e.g., year after year), as well as how attributes relate to/affect changes in topology. For instance, nodes/authors can be labeled with their main institution. As this affiliation changes over time, it is likely that the researcher's opportunities for collaboration change as well.\n",

    "### Backend Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is designed to work with complex temporal data, ASH offers two storage backends with different performance characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Backend | Storage | Best For | Complexity |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------|------------|\n",
    "| **Dense** (default) | time → set(hyperedge_ids) | Dense timelines, frequent snapshot queries | materialise: O(1), add: O(1) |\n",
    "| **Interval** | hyperedge_id → [(start, end)] | Sparse temporal data, long-lived entities | materialise: O(N×log k), add: O(1) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Dense backend (default) - best for frequent queries\n",
    "ash_dense = ASH()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interval backend - best for sparse temporal networks\n",
    "ash_interval = ASH(backend=\"interval\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Interval backend:**\n",
    "- Working with long-lived entities or hyperedges\n",
    "- Sparse temporal data (few active times per entity)\n",
    "- Memory-constrained environments\n",
    "- Fewer snapshot queries compared to updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Note:**  \n",
    "The Interval backend uses two key optimizations:\n",
    "1. **Binary search (bisect)**: O(log k) lookup per entity instead of O(k) linear scan, where k is the average number of intervals per entity\n",
    "2. **Event-difference arrays**: O(1) updates for interval additions/removals using difference arrays, avoiding O(length) per-time loops\n",
    "\n",
    "These optimizations provide ~10x performance improvements for interval-based operations while maintaining identical output to the Dense backend."
